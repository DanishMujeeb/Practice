This was a personal project, in which I created a sports matching game. In this game there are 12 cards on the screen. When a user clicks on a card a sport will appear. They are to click on another card to find the same sport. If the second card they click is not the same sport as the first one, then the cards will go back to how they originally were. If however, the cards are the same then they will disappear. The user has 20 seconds to find all the matches or else they lose.
